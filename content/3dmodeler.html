		<div>This is a 3D modeler I made.</div>
		<div>I made it because I had an idea for a game, but the model files it required didn't store properties I needed, so I built my own modeler. I did not expect to make this public when creating the project, so it's not very user friendly, but there is a guide on how to get started.</div>
