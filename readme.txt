This website features code from:
https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/js-search-bar
to provide search bar functionality.

If this looks like it was made in a rush it's because it is.
Firefox wouldn't let me use file:/// imports, so I have to
do build the website WHILE the project is hosted, not before.

Enjoy your stay.
